# ReinforcementExamples
I am learning reinfocement learning based on pytorch, and will record the projects in this repository

-Environments and Install\
As pytorch 2.6.0 need python 3.9 or later, Gym needs 3.7-3.10. Use python 3.10 is a good choice. And basic conda env is in [pytorchgym.yml](https://github.com/YKXu-c/ReinforcementExamples/edit/main/pytorchgym.yml)\
You can just use `conda env create -f pytorchgym.yml` to create the same env in your PC.
